**This project is still in a very early alpha - expect the software to have errors.**

A simple-to-use application for verifying hashes of files, free for everyone. Made with .NET MAUI.

## Remaining work

This application is not done yet, and there is several things that needs implementation.

1. More test-cases of the hashing computations, and more testing of the application itself.
2. Make the "Copy" and "Verify" buttons nicer. Right now their color scheme is a bit confusing.
3. Add an app logo, s.t. it shows a different logo than the purple ".NET" in the dock.
4. CI/CD pipeline.
5. Testing on Windows. Has only been tested on macOS so far.
6. (Nice to have) Fade-animation when progressbar shows / verify field shows.
